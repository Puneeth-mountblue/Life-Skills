# According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

According to Fisher’s Model of Reflective Listening, the key points focus on slowing down the conversation, understanding the speaker’s message and emotions,
and reflecting it back without adding personal assumptions or judgments.

1. Listening for Content
2. Listening for Feelings
3. Reflecting Back in Your Own Words
4. Validating the Speaker’s Experience
5. Avoiding Judgment, Advice, or Premature Solutions
6. Staying Focused on the Speaker, Not on Your Response
7. Checking for Accuracy (“Did I get that right?”)

**Essence of Fisher’s Reflective Listening →**
“Understand first, don’t assume, and reflect back without judgment.”

# What are the obstacles in your listening process?

One major obstacle is that I sometimes think about my response while the other person is still speaking.
Instead of fully paying attention to their complete message, my mind jumps ahead to what I want to say next.
Because of this, I may miss important details or misunderstand their point. This usually happens during discussions or debates when I feel the need to defend my viewpoint.

Another obstacle is forming judgments too quickly. When I disagree with something, I sometimes start evaluating the message internally instead of listening with an open mind.
This creates a mental barrier and makes it harder to truly understand the speaker’s intention.

I also struggle with external distractions—such as phone notifications, background noise, or my thoughts wandering at the wrong moment.
These factors break my focus and reduce the quality of my listening.

# What can you do to improve your listening?

Improving my listening skills is important because good listening builds trust, avoids misunderstandings, and improves communication overall.
I identified a few practical steps that can help me become a more attentive and present listener.

-> First, I can work on being **fully present** in conversations. This means giving the speaker my undivided attention and avoiding multitasking.
Putting away distracting devices or closing irrelevant tabs will help me stay focused.

-> Second, I can practice **patience** and let the speaker finish before responding. Sometimes I feel the urge to jump in or offer advice too quickly,
but waiting until the person is done speaking helps them feel heard and respected.

-> Third, I can **reflect back** what I understood or ask clarifying questions when something feels unclear.
This ensures that I have truly understood the speaker’s message and reduces the chances of miscommunication.

# When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

Although I try to communicate assertively, there are moments when I slip into a passive communication style.
This usually happens when I feel uncomfortable sharing my true thoughts or when I worry that expressing my opinion might upset someone.

One common situation is when I’m around dominant or outspoken people. If someone speaks with a lot of confidence or intensity,
I sometimes stay silent even when I have something meaningful to say. I choose not to speak up to avoid disagreement or conflict.

Another example is when I prioritize other people’s feelings over my own preferences. If a friend or family member suggests something I’m not fully comfortable with,
I often agree just to keep the peace—even if I had a different choice in mind.

# When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

Even though I try to stay respectful, there are certain situations where I find myself shifting into an aggressive communication style.
This usually happens when strong emotions take over, especially frustration or a sense of being unheard.

One common situation is when I feel repeatedly ignored or interrupted. If I try several times to express something and people still don’t listen,
I sometimes raise my voice or speak more forcefully. In that moment, my focus shifts from communicating clearly to making sure my point is acknowledged.

I also notice aggressive tendencies when I’m stressed or under pressure. If I am overwhelmed with work and someone asks for assistance or points out an issue,
My response may sound sharper or more irritated than I intend, even if they didn’t mean any harm.

# When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

Even though I aim for open communication, there are times when I unintentionally slip into passive-aggressive behavior.
This often happens when I’m upset but don’t feel ready or comfortable sharing my feelings directly.

One situation is when I feel hurt or annoyed but decide not to talk about it. Instead of addressing the issue,
I may withdraw, give short replies, or use silent treatment. I tell myself that “it’s not worth discussing,” even though the issue still bothers me inside.

I also notice passive-aggressive behavior when my efforts go unnoticed or unappreciated.
If I work hard on something and no one acknowledges it, I may respond with mild sarcasm or distance,
hoping the other person understands how I feel without me having to say it directly.

# How can you make your communication assertive? What are some steps you can apply in your own life?

Assertive communication means expressing thoughts, feelings, and needs openly and respectfully—without being passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive.
It’s about balancing honesty with consideration for others.

### **I can make my communication more assertive by following these steps:**

1. **Be Clear About Your Needs and Feelings**
   Before speaking, I can take a moment to understand what I want to communicate.
   This helps me express myself honestly without sounding blaming or defensive.

2. **Use “I” Statements**
   Instead of accusing others, I can express my own experience, such as:
   *“I feel unheard when I’m interrupted, and I would appreciate finishing my point.”*

3. **Maintain a Calm and Respectful Tone**
   Assertiveness requires confidence without aggression.
   Keeping a calm tone and open body language helps me communicate firmly but respectfully.

4. **Practice and Self-Reflection**
   By reviewing past conversations where I reacted passively or aggressively,
   I can understand what triggered me and learn how to respond more assertively in the future.

5. **Be Confident but Open to Feedback**
   Assertiveness is not about dominating someone; it’s about expressing my perspective while still being willing to listen.
   This helps create balanced, respectful communication.

6. **Set Healthy Boundaries**
   Saying “no” when needed and expressing limits clearly helps maintain emotional well-being
   and prevents frustration or burnout.
