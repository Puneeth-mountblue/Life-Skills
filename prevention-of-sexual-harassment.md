* Sexual comments, jokes, teasing, or remarks about body/appearance
* Showing or sharing sexual images, videos, messages, or links
* Repeated unwanted attention, flirting, or asking for dates
* Sexual gestures, staring, or leering
* Sending inappropriate emails, chats, or messages
* Threats, pressure, or promises linked to sexual favors

* Clearly say no and ask the person to stop (if safe to do so)
* Document incidents with dates, time, place, and witnesses
* Report to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or HR
