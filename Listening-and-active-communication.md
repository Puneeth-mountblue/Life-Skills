# According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

According to Fisher’s Model of Reflective Listening, the key points focus on slowing down the conversation, understanding the speaker’s message and emotions,
and reflecting it back without adding your own assumptions or judgments.

1. Listening for Content
2. Listening for Feelings
3. Reflecting Back in Your Own Words
4. Validating the Speaker’s Experience
5. Avoiding Judgment, Advice, or Premature Solutions
6. Staying Focused on the Speaker, Not on Your Response
7. Checking for Accuracy (“Did I get that right?”) — small addition

**Essence of Fisher’s Reflective Listening →**
“Understand first, don’t assume, and reflect back without judgment.”

# What are the obstacles in your listening process?

One major obstacle is that I sometimes think about my response while the other person is still speaking.
Instead of fully paying attention to their complete message, my mind jumps ahead to how I am going to answer.
Because of this, I may miss important details or misunderstand their point. This usually happens during discussions or debates when I feel the need to defend my viewpoint.

Another obstacle is forming judgments too quickly. When I disagree with something, I sometimes start evaluating the message internally
instead of listening openly. This creates a mental barrier and prevents me from understanding the speaker’s intention clearly.

A third obstacle is **external distractions**—such as notifications, noise, or my own wandering thoughts. (small addition)

# What can you do to improve your listening?

Improving my listening skills is important because good listening builds stronger relationships, prevents misunderstandings, and makes communication smoother.
I have identified several practical steps that can help me become a more attentive listener.

-> First, I can work on being **fully present** in conversations. This means giving the speaker my complete attention and avoiding multitasking.
To support this, I will silence or put away distractions like my phone or unnecessary tabs, so I can focus fully on the conversation.

-> Second, I can practice **patience** and allow the speaker to finish without interrupting. Sometimes I feel tempted to jump to advice or solutions, but I understand this can make the speaker feel unheard.
I will remind myself to pause, listen completely, and then respond thoughtfully.

-> Third, I can **reflect back** key points or ask clarifying questions when something is unclear. (small addition)

# When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

Although I try to communicate assertively, there are situations where I shift into a passive communication style.
This usually happens when I feel uncomfortable expressing my needs or when I worry that my opinion might create conflict.

One common situation is when I am around very dominant or outspoken people. If someone talks confidently or forcefully, I sometimes hold back my thoughts even when I have something valuable to contribute.
I choose silence instead of sharing my perspective because I want to avoid disagreement or tension.

Another example is when I prioritize other people’s feelings over my own preferences. If a friend or family member suggests plans I don’t fully agree with, I often just go along with it to maintain harmony.
Even though I may have a different choice, I stay quiet to avoid upsetting anyone.

# When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

Although I try to stay calm and respectful, there are moments when strong emotions cause me to shift into an aggressive style.
This usually happens when I feel frustrated, impatient, or unheard.

One situation is when I feel ignored or interrupted repeatedly. If I try multiple times to express myself and people still don’t listen, I sometimes raise my voice or speak more forcefully.
In that moment, my priority shifts from clear communication to ensuring I am heard—even if it creates tension.

I also notice aggressive communication when I am under stress or pressure. If I’m overwhelmed with tasks and someone asks for something unexpectedly, I may sound irritated or short.
Even if the person didn’t intend to upset me, my stress affects the way I respond.

# When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

Even though I try to communicate openly, there are times when I slip into passive-aggressive behavior.
This usually happens when I feel upset but don’t feel comfortable expressing my true feelings directly.

One common moment is when I feel hurt or annoyed but avoid talking about it. Instead of expressing my emotions clearly, I may withdraw, give short answers, or use silent treatment.
I convince myself that “it’s not worth discussing,” even though the issue still bothers me internally.

I also notice passive-aggressiveness when my efforts are ignored or unappreciated. If I worked hard on something and it goes unnoticed, I may respond with distance or mild sarcasm like, “Sure, as always, no one notices.”
This becomes a way of showing my feelings indirectly instead of addressing the issue openly.

# How can you make your communication assertive? What are some steps you can apply in your own life?

Assertive communication means expressing thoughts, feelings, and needs clearly and respectfully—without being passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive.
It is the balance between being honest and being considerate.

### **I can make my communication more assertive by following these steps:**

1. **Be Clear About Your Needs and Feelings**
   Before speaking, I can take a moment to understand what I truly want to express.
   This helps me communicate without blaming or attacking.

2. **Use “I” Statements**
   Instead of blaming or accusing, I can express my experience clearly:
   *“I feel unheard when I’m interrupted, and I would appreciate finishing my point.”*

3. **Maintain a Calm and Respectful Tone**
   Assertiveness is firm but polite. I can control my tone, avoid shouting,
   and maintain open body language (eye contact, relaxed posture).

4. **Practice and Self-Reflection**
   I can reflect on situations where I was passive or aggressive and consider how I could respond more effectively next time.
   Practicing with friends or in low-stakes situations can help build confidence.

5. **Be Confident but Open to Feedback**
   Assertiveness is not about winning—it’s about clarity and respect.
   I can express my views confidently while staying open to others’ ideas.

6. **Set Healthy Boundaries** (small addition)
   Saying “no” when necessary and expressing limits clearly helps prevent resentment or burnout.
