## **1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg**

## **2. Tiny Habits – Core Message**

### **Question 2 – How to use B = MAP**

B = MAP means **Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and Prompt come together**.
To build new habits:

* Make sure you have **some motivation (M)**,
* Make the habit **easy to do (A)**,
* And use a clear **prompt (P)** to remind you.
  When all three align, habits form more easily.

### **What M, A, P mean**

* **M – Motivation:** Desire to do the behavior.
* **A – Ability:** How easy the behavior is.
* **P – Prompt:** A reminder that triggers the action.

### **Question 3 – Why celebrate ("Shine")?**

Celebrating makes your brain feel good, so it connects that positive feeling with the habit. This emotional reward helps the habit stick faster because your brain wants to repeat actions that feel successful.

## **3. 1% Better Every Day**

### **Question 4 – Most interesting idea**

Your identity drives your actions.

  This makes the habit more likely to happen.
