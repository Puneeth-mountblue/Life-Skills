## **Question 3**

### **What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

* **Active Mode:**
  A focused, conscious, highly attentive state where you deliberately try to understand or solve something.

* **Diffused Mode:**
  A relaxed, open, daydream-like state where your brain makes broader connections in the background, helping with creativity and problem-solving.

## **Question 5**

### **What are some actions you can take to improve your learning process?**

Here are actions based on the Bootcamp principles and learning science:

#### **1. Improve Focus & Attention**

* Practice 100% involvement when learning or coding.
* Keep your phone on silent and turn off non-work notifications.
* Use tools like Freedom, TimeLimit, or Focus apps to block distractions.
* Track your time using apps like Boosted to understand your productivity patterns.
* Follow the rule: “Work when you work, play when you play.”

#### **2. Use Effective Learning Techniques**

* Apply the Feynman Technique to every concept—teach it to yourself or someone else.
* Switch between focused (active) and diffused thinking by taking short breaks.
* Make learning personal: explain concepts in **your own words.

#### **3. Strengthen Conceptual Understanding**

* Ask questions like:

  * Where is this concept used?*
  * Can I explain it simply?*
  * How can I implement it in code or design?*
* Make the concept “yours” by coding it in different ways or creating small projects.

#### **4. Build a Consistent Practice Routine**

* Set realistic deadlines and use them to manage your time.
* Complete drills and assignments within the time allocated.
* Commit to at least 20 hours of deliberate practice for each important skill.

#### **5. Communicate & Collaborate Better**

* Communicate proactively when stuck.
* Write and speak clearly about what you understand and where your doubts are.
* Share learnings with peers—teaching is mastery.

#### **6. Adopt a Growth Mindset**

* Approach learning with curiosity and joy.
* Believe that skills improve with time and deliberate practice.
* Focus less on talent and more on consistent effort.
